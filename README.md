    + It is **recommended** to revisit this chapter after finishing up the section on Node (Part 3 of Eloquent JS) as it will further improve the understanding of the reader on topics like CommonJS modules and dependencies.

    + I have decided **not to provide** answers of the **1<sup>st</sup> & 3<sup>rd</sup>** programming exercises due to the theoretical, opinion based nature of the questions.

        You are more than welcome to attempt these questions and (if you want) look at possible solutions on the official site.

    + **NOTE**: The solution to the **2<sup>nd</sup>** programming exercise (while correct) will only work on your if both **NodeJS** & **graph** module/package are **installed** on your system.

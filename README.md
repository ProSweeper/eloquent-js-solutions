    + I have decided **not to provide** answers of the **1<sup>st</sup> & 3<sup>rd</sup>** programming exercises due to the theoretical, opinion based nature of the questions.

        You are more than welcome to attempt these questions and (if you want) look at possible solutions on the official site.

    + **NOTE**: The solution to the **2<sup>nd</sup>** programming exercise (while correct) will only work on your if both **NodeJS** & **graph** module/package are **installed** on your system.

        You are more than welcome to attempt these questions and (if you want) look at possible solutions on the official site.

        I was only able to get them partially right, but was **unsuccessful** *in writing a solution that met all of the given requirements*, of a particular question.

        Initially, I wanted to upload my imperfect solutions but then also realized that uploading them could potentially lead the readers to reach adopt bad practices/code.

        Due to the aforementioned reason, all of my uploaded solutions are **IDENTICAL** to the given solutions on the official site.

18. [HTTP and Forms](https://eloquentjavascript.net/18_http.html "Jump to Chapter 18 on the Official Site")

    + This chapter, I believe, will be most useful to intermediate level learners who knows the basics of the language or client-side web development.

        A lot of semi-advanced topics are covered in this chapter, including the concept of AJAX calls using the `fetch` API or client-side storage facilities (in the form of `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.

    + I definitely feel that the third programming exercise of this chapter, "[Conway's Game of Life](https://eloquentjavascript.net/18_http.html#i_XyKQVmCbTN "Jump to Problem Statement of 'Conway's Game of Life' on Official Site")", is the **best non-project based programming exercise** of the book. Answering this question requires the knowledge of almost all of the lessons taught in the book. 

        Also, the subject matter of the question is also exciting, because it is a simulation of "artificial life" on a grid of cells.

        Also, what makes this question even more appealing is the fact that you can approach it in a myriad of ways and make it as easy or difficult as you desire. You can also use this question as a foundation to a more feature-rich version of the simulation.

19. [Project: A Pixel Art Editor](https://eloquentjavascript.net/19_paint.html "Jump to Chapter 19 on the Official Site") (**SKIPPED**)

    + I have decided to **skip** this chapter even though, this is definitely the most complex project in the book because I simply don't have the time to study it.

        This is a wonderful project for anyone who is interested in doing graphics-heavy work on the web but unfortunately, I had different goals in mind, when I began with this ebook.

        My primary purpose was to learn the fundamentals of the JavaScript language and make myself familiar with the subject of DOM manipulation and performing HTTP(S) request(s) via AJAX calls. This was the main reason why I enjoyed Chapter 18 so much because it dealt with topics that I wished to learn in the first place.

    + Initially, I wanted to do a line-by-line analysis of the project but then I realized, my lack of interest would consequentially lead me to look at the solved solution set. This was something that I really didn't wish to do as I already felt guilty about, since I basically uploaded the solved solution set of Chapter 17.

        Hence, I have decided to not upload any kind of solutions since these are not mine. If the situation ever changes, I will update the repository.
